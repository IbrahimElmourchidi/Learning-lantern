**Auth-api story 005: change user's data**

_As a developer I want:_

- Create new profile entity and create one-to-one relation with the user.
- move the first and last name to the profile entity (All Details on the [database ERD](https://github.com/IbrahimElmourchidi/Learning-lantern#database) ) and refactor the code.
- add the isConfirmed field to the user entity to check if the user was confrimed by the university admins.
- create the following end points:
  - change password end point
  - change email end point
  - delete account end point
  - validate email end point
  - resend validation email
- close the feature and push every thing on github

_Acceptance Criteria_:

- when change the email the user must recieve a new activation link to the new email.
- test all endpoints using postman.
