**Auth-api story 002: Create The User Module**

_As a developer I want:_

- Create User Module that is responsible with all user related logic.
- Create the User Entity (All Details on the [database ERD](https://github.com/IbrahimElmourchidi/Learning-lantern2/blob/main/server/auth-api/README.md#database) ).
- Create User Service to handle all database interaction related to user.
- Create the UserController with the following endpoints:
  - POST user/signup : to create new user.
  - GET user/all : to get all users paginated.
  - GET user/{id}: to get a user by its id
  - PUT user/update/{id}: to update user name
- close the feature and push every thing on github

_Acceptance Criteria_:

- all password must be hashed. ( install bcrypt)
- all responeses with user data must be serialized ( remove all sensitive data from the response). ( this can be achieved using interceptors)
- all email in the database for the user must be in lowercase. ( this can be achieved using middle ware)
- test all endpoints using postman.
