**Auth-api story 003: Create the Login end point**

_As a developer I want:_

- Create auth Module that is responsible for all authentication & authorization related logic.
- install jwt needed library.
- create jwt gaurd to check if the user have avalid jwt.
- add login method in the user service
- add the following endpoints to the user controller:
  - POST user/login : to create new user.
- refactor the user entity to contain the role field instead of the isAdmin
- close the feature and push every thing on github

_Acceptance Criteria_:

- the user is issued a JWT when login
- get all users route must be gaurded so that only admin users with valid JWT can access.
- test all endpoints using postman.
